Direct2dOnWPF
=============

An example C# project which shows the usage of direct2d within a WPF window via SharpDX. The project also includes some classes, which you can directly copy to your project. 

The library in the example project can be used as a starting point to derive your Direct2DControl by just overwriting the Render method. 

Everything in this project is free for use, but I do not give warranty of any kind.
